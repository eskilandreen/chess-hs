Chess in Haskell
================

This is a chess game written in Haskell. I wrote a similar program in a course
on programming paradigms that I took at KTH. That was more than 10 years ago,
and I wanted to see if I could do it again without any guidance. I also wanted
an excuse to play around with graphics in Haskell.

Instructions for running:

* Update cabal: `cabal update`
* Create cabal sandbox: `cabal sandbox init`
* Install dependencies: `cabal install --dependencies-only`
* Run: `cabal run`
